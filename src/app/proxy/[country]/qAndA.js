        question: 'What is a free proxy server?',
        answer: 'A free proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet, allowing you to browse anonymously and access restricted content without any cost. It helps mask your IP address by routing your internet traffic through the proxy’s server. This way, when you visit websites or use online services, it appears as though the traffic is coming from the proxy server, not your actual location. Whether you’re using a free web proxy, a free proxy site, or a proxy server free of charge, these tools provide a simple way to enhance your online privacy.'
